# FreeBSD and Linux - Usage and Advocracy
The goal of this website, hosted on GitHub, is to provide users with tips on how to use FreeBSD and Linux contribute to its development. My expectation is that it will be possible to increase the number of FreeBSD and Linux users and also help in its development (whether through code, documentation, or any other type of service).  
Requests for tutorials can be made via my email cndghm@gmail.com.  
I am willing to carry out the relevant research and patches so that everyone has a good experience with the system.
